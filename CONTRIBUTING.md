# Contributing to Gramps MCP

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Gramps MCP! This guide will help you get started with development and contributing to the project.

## Quick Start

1. **Fork and Clone**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gramps-mcp.git
cd gramps-mcp
```

2. **Setup Development Environment**:
```bash
# Install uv (if not already installed)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Install dependencies including dev tools
uv sync
```

3. **Setup Pre-commit Hooks** (recommended):
```bash
uv run pre-commit install
```

## Development Workflow

### Testing

This project follows **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** practices:

```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest

# Run specific test file
uv run pytest tests/test_search_basic.py

# Run with verbose output
uv run pytest -xvs

# Run specific test
uv run pytest tests/test_search_basic.py::TestFindPersonTool::test_find_person -xvs
```

**Important**: Tests use real Gramps Web API connections (no mocks). Ensure you have a test Gramps Web instance configured in your `.env` file.

### Code Quality

We maintain high code quality standards:

```bash
# Lint code
uv run ruff check src/

# Format code
uv run ruff format src/

# Type checking (if available)
uv run mypy src/
```

Pre-commit hooks will automatically run these checks on commit.

### Project Structure

Follow the established architecture:

```
src/gramps_mcp/
|-- server.py           # MCP server setup
|-- tools/              # Tool implementations by feature
|-- client.py           # Gramps Web API client
|-- auth.py             # Authentication handling
|-- models/             # Pydantic models
|-- handlers/           # Data formatting
`-- config.py          # Configuration
```

## Contributing Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow **PEP 8** conventions
- Use **type hints** for all functions
- Write **Google-style docstrings**:
```python
def example_function(param1: str, param2: int) -> bool:
    """
    Brief description of the function.

    Args:
        param1: Description of first parameter.
        param2: Description of second parameter.

    Returns:
        Description of return value.
    """
```

### File Length Limit

- **Never create files longer than 500 lines**
- Refactor large files into smaller, focused modules
- Split by feature or responsibility

### Testing Requirements

- **Write tests first** (TDD approach)
- **No mocks** - use real API integration tests
- Test files mirror the `src/` structure in `tests/`
- All new features must include comprehensive tests

### Commit Messages

Follow the established pattern:
```
type: Brief description

Longer description if needed

## Development Setup

### Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure:
```bash
GRAMPS_API_URL=https://your-test-gramps-instance.com
GRAMPS_USERNAME=your-username
GRAMPS_PASSWORD=your-password
GRAMPS_TREE_ID=your-tree-id
```

### Running the Server

For development, you have several options:

```bash
# Option 1: Use Docker with local build (recommended for development)
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d

# Option 2: Run directly with uv (requires local setup)
# HTTP transport (development)
uv run python -m src.gramps_mcp.server

# Stdio transport (testing)
uv run python -m src.gramps_mcp.server stdio
```

**Note**: The main `docker-compose.yml` uses pre-built images from GitHub Container Registry. For development with local code changes, use `docker-compose.dev.yml` which builds from your local source.

## Image Registry

Docker images are automatically published to GitHub Container Registry via GitHub Actions:

- **Latest stable**: `ghcr.io/fjacquet/gramps-mcp:latest`
- **Specific versions**: `ghcr.io/fjacquet/gramps-mcp:v1.0.0`
- **Development**: `ghcr.io/fjacquet/gramps-mcp:main`

Images are built for multiple architectures:
- `linux/amd64` (Intel/AMD processors)
- `linux/arm64` (ARM processors, including Apple Silicon)

### Image Publishing

Images are automatically built and published when:
- **Push to main branch** → `ghcr.io/fjacquet/gramps-mcp:main`
- **Release tags** → `ghcr.io/fjacquet/gramps-mcp:v1.2.3` and `ghcr.io/fjacquet/gramps-mcp:latest`

The GitHub Actions workflow handles multi-architecture builds, proper tagging, and registry authentication automatically.
